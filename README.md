# The No-Shoelace Place

Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the United States experience mental illness in a year. Many experiences of mental illness are horrific and sometimes even deadly, but there are options for support including therapy, medication, and in-patient programs. 

Additionally, the stigma surrounding mental illness persists, perpetuating shame and silence. To change the conversation and dispel this stigma, it is crucial to foster open conversations, educate the public, and promote a culture of acceptance, empathy, and support for those affected by these invisible battles.

Through storytelling and interactivity, The No-Shoelace Place is part of the effort to release the stigma around mental illness. This game is a text-based choose your own adventure game in which you (the patient) needs to utilize creative imagination and problem solving to discover the mysteries and secrets of a locked psychiatric ward and find the path to freedom.
